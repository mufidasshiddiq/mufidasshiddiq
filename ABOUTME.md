<h2>Hi! I'm <b>M</b>. (or <b>Mufid</b>, if you can pronounce it 😅)</h2>

<p>&#128215 I'm an <b>undergraduate student</b> from <b>Universitas Indonesia</b>.</p>

<p>&#128187 I'm aspiring to become a web engineer by learning through online courses as well as other online materials.
Although my Economics study might not relate to web engineering, I've been comfortable in technologies and
computer-related engineering since I was fond of gaming modifications (mods).</p>

<p>&#127758 I believe everyone should have a good website for their bussiness or any other uses (especially, landing pages).
Because of that, I want to help people have reliable websites in this disruptive information era.</p>

My current learning:
- HTML
- CSS
- Python
- Git and GitHub
- SSH
